Module "Pins1"     (component PinSettings)

Module "CsIO1"     (component ConsoleIO)

Module "SM1"       (component SPIMaster_LDD)
   - SM1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SM1_Enable -This method enables SPI device. This method is intended to be used together with <Disable()> method to 
                temporary switch On/Off the device after the device is initialized. This method is required if the <Enabled in 
                init. code> property is set to "no" value.
   - SM1_Disable -Disables the SPI device. When the device is disabled, some component methods should not be called. If so, 
                error ERR_DISABLED may be reported. This method is intended to be used together with <Enable()> method to 
                temporary switch on/off the device after the device is initialized. This method is not required. The <Deinit()> 
                method can be used to switch off and uninstall the device.
   - SM1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters. The method returns ERR_BUSY when the previous block transmission is not 
                completed. The method <CancelBlockTransmission> can be used to cancel a transmit operation. This method 
                finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data transmission. Use event <OnBlockSent> 
                to check the end of data transmission or method GetSentDataNum to check the state of sending.
   - SM1_ReceiveBlock -This method specifies the number of data to receive. The method returns ERR_BUSY until the specified 
                number of characters is received. The method <CancelBlockReception> can be used to cancel a running receive 
                operation. If a receive operation is not in progress (the method was not called or a previous operation has 
                already finished) all received characters will be lost without any notification. To prevent the loss of data 
                call the method immediately after the last receive operation has finished (e.g. from the <OnBlockReceived> 
                event). This method finishes immediately after calling it - it doesn't wait the end of data reception. Use 
                event <OnBlockReceived> to check the end of data reception or method GetReceivedDataNum to check the state of 
                receiving.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.
   - WAIT1_Init -Driver initialization routine.
   - WAIT1_DeInit -Driver de-initialization routine

Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "IFsh1"     (component IntFLASH)
   - IFsh1_DisableEvent -This method disables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_EnableEvent -This method enables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_EraseFlash -Erases entire memory array of the selected Flash block.
   - IFsh1_SetByteFlash -Writes a byte to an address in FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" 
                property and state of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.
   - IFsh1_GetByteFlash -Gets byte from an address in FLASH.
   - IFsh1_SetWordFlash -Writes a word to an address in FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" 
                property and state of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.
   - IFsh1_SetBlockFlash -Writes data to FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" property and state 
                of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.
   - IFsh1_GetBlockFlash -Reads data from FLASH.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK64FN1M0LL12)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
